This project had many difficulties in it. The first and probably biggest hurdle I encountered was how to create a GUI for the project so that the user can interact with the program. I order to do this I researched for hours and learned about the tkinter module. I had to install the files for it onto my laptop and watch hours of turtorials on how it worked. Since it was so new to me it had a large learning curve. The easier part of the project was to integrate text and images which we have done before in class. The new material made it diffucult to acheive my initial golas of the project. For example I wanted to create code that if given parameter would randomly generate questions based on a specefic topic but instead I had to program a limited numb er of questions remotely into python. The final difficulty was making everything come together. Because this project was more complicated than anything I had done before I couldn't use Idle and opted for visual studio code but this also had an associated learning curve. After doing more resaerch on GUI's I came across the software Figma which allowed one to create GUI's and give them function. With figma I was able to program buttons and make the variouse python files flow into one another to create a quiz. If I had more time I would have set up a point system and added animation to it.
